1. Add State Management (due to the bottneck to add redux and to have since the current page is efficient without state management, skipped the step for now, but if we have plan to scale the page (whcih obviously exists, redux/apollo client is suggested))

2. Currently the router setup is done, but for each category clicks, different route with filtered data of each specific category selected should be shown (TBD)

3. When "Add to cart" is clicked the item should be added to the list and to be shown during checkout

4. Search can be taken globally, it should also be debounced

5. API support for each category viz data retrieve should also be updated

6. Sidebar should be taken out as a differnt component and used in the App level rather than in each component level

7. Write unit test cases.
